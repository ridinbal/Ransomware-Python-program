# Ransomware-Python-program

The goal of this laboratory project is to develop a basic Python ransomware that encrypts specific .txt files within a designated directory. The encryption process utilizes a hybrid encryption scheme that combines RSA-based asymmetric key pairs and AES_CBC-based symmetric keys. This encryption scheme is applied individually to each targeted file.
